## Overview

The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP) was published as RFC 2324 on April 1, 1998, defining the HTTP 418 "I'm a teapot" status code and specifying how to control coffee pots over the internet. RFC 7168 extended it for tea in 2014.

CPIP implements the full HTCPCP specification and extends it into a multi-transport mesh communication system with active network defense. The protocol operates over four transport layers — LAN, satellite, radio (LoRa/TNC), and mobile broadband — with end-to-end encryption, store-and-forward messaging, and covert channels. All HTCPCP brew requests and responses double as cover traffic for encrypted mesh messages.

The defense groups (Anti-ISP, Anti-Stingray, Anti-Surveillance, Net Neutrality) each have dedicated tabs with per-vector toggles reachable via API or dashboard.

The status bar displays live badges for brewing state, GPIO, mesh, covert, ITF stealth, NTP, and SSE connection status. A live event log shows real-time brew and mesh message events via Server-Sent Events.

## ITF Defense System

The ITF (In The Face) module implements active network defense by identifying and blocking hostile probes using multiple detection heuristics. Blocked probes receive HTTP 418 "I'm a teapot" responses.

### Detection Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scanner paths | Requests to /admin, /config, /wp-, /.env, /phpmyadmin, /shell, /cmd, /exec, /backdoor, /login, /setup, /install, /manager, /console (+3 probe score) |
| Missing headers | BREW without Accept-Additions on non-standard paths (+1 probe score) |
| Unknown URI schemes | Non-coffee URIs (+2 probe score) |
| Pentest tool fingerprinting | User-Agent and header inspection for 16 security tools (+2 probe score) |
| Rate limiting | Repeated probes double the ban duration (up to 24 hours) |

Threshold: probe score >= 2 results in 418 response and IP blacklisting.

### Detected Tools

The following tools are detected by User-Agent fingerprinting: Burp Suite, Nmap, SQLMap, Nikto, Gobuster, Dirb, FFUF, WFuzz, OpenVAS, Nessus, Masscan, ZAP, Arachni, w3af, Metasploit, Acunetix.

Informational tools (cURL, Wget, Python, Go-http) are tracked in the dashboard but do not trigger blocking.

### Runtime Controls

- **Stealth mode** — Toggle via `POST /cpip/defense {"action":"stealth","enabled":true}` or dashboard button
- **Blacklist** — Whitelist individual IPs, clear entire blacklist, probe any IP
- **Transport toggles** — Enable or disable satellite/mobile at runtime via API

### Blacklist Behavior

- Base TTL: 1 hour (`CPIP_DEFENSE_BLACKLIST_TTL`)
- Rate limit: 10 probes within 60 seconds doubles the ban duration
- Maximum entries: 1000 (oldest half pruned on overflow)
- Localhost (127.0.0.1, ::1) is never blacklisted

## Multi-Transport Architecture

CPIP supports four mesh transports with automatic message forwarding between all transports (routing loops are prevented).

| Transport | Env Flag | Port | Runtime Toggle | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|----------------|-------------|
| LAN Mesh | `CPIP_MESH=1` | 4191 | None | UDP heartbeat mesh on local network |
| Satellite | `CPIP_SAT=1` | 4195 | `POST /cpip/mesh/sat` | Internet-wide UDP relay with GPS coordinates |
| Radio | `CPIP_RADIO=1` | Unix socket | None | LoRa SPI, KISS TNC serial, or simulation |
| Mobile | `CPIP_MOBILE=1` | 4196 | `POST /cpip/mesh/mobile` | 4G/5G WWAN mesh with signal telemetry |

Satellite and mobile transports can be enabled or disabled at runtime without restarting the server.

### LAN Mesh

Nodes discover each other via UDP heartbeats on port 4191. Messages use store-and-forward delivery with ECDH P-256 E2EE by default. Port hopping and stealth mode are supported. No internet connection required — works over Ethernet, WiFi, WiFi Direct, or any IP-based network.

### Satellite Mesh

Internet-wide mesh relay using UDP port 4195, designed for satellite links with high latency. Features GPS coordinate broadcasting (lat/lon/alt), bootstrap seed nodes for peer discovery, and configurable timeouts for high-latency links. Dual env var naming (`CPIP_SAT_*` / `CPIP_STARLINK_*`) for backward compatibility.

### Radio Transport (LoRa / TNC)

C-based radio interface with zero external dependencies. Built with `gcc -O2 -Wall -pthread`. Supports:
- **SX1276/SX1278 LoRa** via SPI (full register map)
- **KISS TNC** serial (AX.25 over serial via termios)
- **RTL-SDR receive** (requires librtlsdr, build with `make RTL=1`)
- **Simulation mode** — requires explicit `--sim` flag; LoRa mode requires real hardware
- Default mode is `lora` (not `sim`)
- Duty cycle enforcement and listen-before-talk

The Python bridge (`radio/radio_protocol.py`) communicates with the C binary over a Unix domain socket (`/tmp/cpip-radio.sock`).

### Mobile Broadband (4G/5G / LTE / WWAN)

UDP-based mesh transport over cellular data interfaces. Features include automatic signal quality reading via ModemManager (`mmcli`) and sysfs, bootstrap seed nodes for peer discovery, TCP keepalive-compatible heartbeat intervals, and RSRP/RSSI/SINR telemetry.

## Covert Channel

Messages can be embedded inside legitimate HTCPCP brew requests. The `Accept-Additions` header carries data disguised as coffee customization:

```
Accept-Additions: milk;variety=48656c6c, syrup;variety=6f20576f, sugar;variety=726c6421
```

The system generates cover traffic (random brew requests at configurable intervals) to obscure which requests carry real messages. The dashboard Covert tab provides encode, decode, and persistent history functionality.

## Cryptography

All cryptographic primitives use FIPS-compliant algorithms via the `cryptography` library, which provides constant-time implementations. The `secrets` module replaces `random` for all security-relevant operations. Post-quantum KEM is available via the `b4dm4n-cw` CLI (non-FIPS).

### CoffeeCipher v3 (AES-256-GCM)

- Cipher: AES-256-GCM (FIPS 197) with 12-byte nonce and 16-byte authentication tag
- Key derivation: HKDF-SHA256 with domain-separated info strings
- Format: `nonce(12B) || ciphertext || GCM-tag(16B)`
- Backward-compatible: reads v1 and v2 messages transparently

### ECDSA/ECDH P-256

- Key exchange: ECDH over NIST P-256 (FIPS 186-4)
- Signatures: ECDSA with P-256 (FIPS 186-4)
- Constant-time implementations via `cryptography` library
- Used for mesh E2EE, node identity, and address book

### 1nf1D3L's Kyber KEM (Post-Quantum, Non-FIPS)

Available via the `b4dm4n-cw` CLI (`inf1del_kyber.py`):

- Variant: Non-FIPS ML-KEM-768 with 1nf1D3L modifications
- Parameters: n=256, k=3, q=3329, eta1=3, eta2=3, du=10, dv=4
- Domain tag: "1NF1D3L-KYBER-V1" on all hash/KDF inputs
- Wider noise: eta=3 (vs FIPS eta=2) for enhanced concrete security
- NTT twiddle perturbation: Per-session random twiddle factors for side-channel resistance
- Coffee recipe binding: Recipe string mixed into KDF
- Key confirmation: Re-encapsulation check (implicit rejection via KDF with z)
- Sizes: PK=1184B, SK=2400B, CT=1120B, SS=32B
- CLI: `./b4dm4n_cw.py {keygen,encaps,decaps,bench,info,tui,coffee}` (positional
  pubkey for `encaps`; positional privkey + ciphertext for `decaps`)

### HybridKEM (Classical + Post-Quantum)

CPIP's hybrid key exchange combines ECDH P-256 with 1nf1D3L's Kyber (ML-KEM-768):

- ECDH P-256 (FIPS 186-4) + 1nf1D3L Kyber (non-FIPS ML-KEM-768)
- Key derivation: HKDF-SHA256 from combined ECDH + Kyber shared secrets
  (domain tag `cpip-hybrid-kem-kyber-v1`)
- Secure if EITHER classical ECDH OR PQ Kyber component holds
- Sizes: PK~1251B, SK~2432B, CT~1187B, SS=32B
- Implemented in `server.HybridKEM` (server.py:1485)
- CLI: select hybrid via `-a hybrid` (alias for `hybrid-ecdh-kyber`), e.g.
  `./b4dm4n_cw.py keygen -a hybrid -o h` / `encaps -a hybrid h.pk` / `decaps -a hybrid h.sk ct`
  (there are no separate `hybrid-keygen`/`hybrid-encaps`/`hybrid-decaps` subcommands)

### HMAC-SHA256

Mesh heartbeat authentication and message integrity verification.

### SHA-256 / SHA3-256

Domain-separated hashing for audit chain and identity; SHA3-256 for Kyber KDF/H.

### Encrypted Persistence

v4 format with AES-256-GCM encryption and HMAC integrity verification. v1/v2 backward-compatible load.

Classical primitives (AES-256-GCM, ECDSA/ECDH P-256, HKDF-SHA256, HMAC-SHA256) are FIPS-compliant. 1nf1D3L's Kyber is not FIPS 203 validated — it is a non-FIPS ML-KEM-768 variant intended for research and experimental use. CPIP does not implement RSA-KEM; the hybrid KEM uses ECDH P-256 + Kyber.

## TLS/SSL

CPIP includes built-in HTTPS support with three modes.

### Auto Self-Signed Certificates

```bash
CPIP_SSL=1 CPIP_SSL_AUTO=1 ./server.py
```

On first startup, CPIP generates a self-signed certificate in `.ssl/cert.pem` and `.ssl/key.pem` using OpenSSL. If OpenSSL is unavailable, it falls back to the Python `cryptography` library, and finally to a minimal stub.

### Custom Certificates

```bash
CPIP_SSL=1 CPIP_SSL_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem CPIP_SSL_KEY=/path/to/key.pem ./server.py
```

### HTTP-to-HTTPS Redirect

```bash
CPIP_SSL=1 CPIP_SSL_AUTO=1 CPIP_HTTP_REDIRECT=1 CPIP_HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT=4181 ./server.py
```

When enabled, all HTTP requests on the redirect port receive a 301 Moved Permanently to the equivalent HTTPS URL.

### Security Headers

When SSL is active, CPIP adds Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Content-Security-Policy, and Upgrade-Insecure-Requests headers.

## Deployment

### Raspberry Pi

```bash
# Full deployment (run as root)
sudo ./deploy.sh

## Minima / PiNet-OS Integration

CPIP v5.0.0 serves as the primary cryptographic security provider for Minima blockchain nodes in the [PiNet-OS](https://github.com/WilliamMajanja/Minima-PiNet-Os) edge computing stack:

| Integration Surface | CPIP Capability |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Data at rest | CoffeeCipher v3 (AES-256-GCM + HKDF-SHA256) |
| Node identity | ECDSA P-256 challenge-response authentication |
| RPC authentication | HMAC-SHA256 time-bounded tokens (replaces Basic Auth) |
| Key encapsulation | HybridKEM — ECDH P-256 + 1nf1D3L Kyber (PQ hybrid) |
| Message signatures | ECDSA P-256 (replaces RSA in Maxima messaging) |
| API defense | ITF Defense (probe blocking, pentest detection, IP blacklisting) |
| FIPS assurance | Power-on self-tests (AES-GCM, HMAC, HKDF, ECDSA, ECDH) |

**Deployment:** CPIP runs as a sidecar container (`cpip:5.0.0`, port 4180) in the Minima k3s DaemonSet and as a dedicated `cpip.service` systemd unit.

**Configuration:** `CPIP_ENABLED=1`, `CPIP_RECIPE=minima`, `CPIP_RPC_AUTH=1`, `CPIP_DEFENSE_ENABLED=1`. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) § Minima Integration for full details.

**PQ Complementarity:** Minima uses WOTS+ (FIPS 205, 128-bit PQ) for consensus signatures. CPIP adds Kyber (non-FIPS ML-KEM-768) for transport encryption. The two approaches are complementary — WOTS+ for consensus, Kyber for key exchange.

The CoffeeCipher v3 uses FIPS-compliant cryptographic primitives (AES-256-GCM, ECDSA/ECDH P-256, HKDF-SHA256, HMAC-SHA256). The hybrid KEM combines ECDH P-256 with 1nf1D3L's Kyber (non-FIPS ML-KEM-768).
