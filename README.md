CPIP v3 is a fully functional implementation of the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control
Protocol that runs on Raspberry Pi. Beneath the HTCPCP brew requests runs a
peer-to-peer mesh network with four transport layers — LAN, satellite,
radio (LoRa/TNC), and mobile broadband — plus covert channels, ECDH P-256 E2EE,
ECDH+RSA-KEM hybrid key exchange, store-and-forward messaging, ITF (In The
Face) active defense, pentest tool detection, incident response with automated
mitigation, and a full CLI client.

## What is this?

The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP) was published as
[RFC 2324](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324) on April 1, 1998 — an
April Fools' Day joke. It defined the now-famous HTTP 418 "I'm a teapot"
status code and specified how to control coffee pots over the internet.
[RFC 7168](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7168) extended it for tea
in 2014 (also April 1).

CPIP takes the joke seriously. It implements the full protocol and extends it
into a multi-transport mesh communication system with active network defense.
The coffee theme provides perfect cover traffic. Every brew request can carry
encrypted data. Every `WHEN` response is a potential message. The protocol
looks like coffee. It is not coffee.

**Your coffee pot is a mesh node. Your teapot fights back. v3 — all fangs out.**

## ITF Defense System

The ITF (In The Face) module is CPIP's active network defense. It identifies
and blocks hostile probes using multiple detection heuristics, all answered
with HTTP 418 "I'm a teapot" — making network mapping and brute-force attacks
indistinguishable from a joke.

### Detection Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scanner paths** | Requests to /admin, /wp-, /.env, /phpmyadmin, /shell, /cmd, /exec, /backdoor, /login, /setup, /install, /manager, /console → +3 probe score |
| **Missing headers** | BREW without Accept-Additions on non-standard paths → +1 probe score |
| **Unknown URI schemes** | Non-coffee URIs → +2 probe score |
| **Pentest tool fingerprinting** | User-Agent and header inspection for 16 security tools → +2 probe score |
| **Rate limiting** | Repeated probes double the ban duration (up to 24h) |

Threshold: probe score ≥ 2 → 418 response + IP blacklisted.

### Detected Tools

The following security tools are automatically fingerprinted by User-Agent:
Burp Suite, Nmap, SQLMap, Nikto, Gobuster, Dirb, FFUF, WFuzz, OpenVAS,
Nessus, Masscan, ZAP, Arachni, w3af, Metasploit, Acunetix.

Informational tools (cURL, Wget, Python, Go-http) are tracked in the
dashboard but do not trigger 418 blocking.

### Runtime Controls

- **Stealth mode** — Toggle via `POST /cpip/defense {"action":"stealth","enabled":true}` or dashboard button
- **Blacklist** — Whitelist individual IPs, clear entire blacklist, probe any IP
- **Satellite/mobile** — Enable or disable transports at runtime via `POST /cpip/mesh/sat` and `POST /cpip/mesh/mobile`

### Blacklist Behavior

- Base TTL: 1 hour (`CPIP_DEFENSE_BLACKLIST_TTL`)
- Rate limit: 10 probes within 60s doubles the ban duration
- Max blacklist: 1000 entries (oldest half pruned)
- Localhost (127.0.0.1, ::1) is never blacklisted

---

## Multi-Transport Architecture

CPIP supports four mesh transports that forward messages between each other
automatically. Messages received on any transport are relayed to all others
(routing loops are prevented).

| Transport | Env Flag | Port | Runtime Toggle | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|----------------|-------------|
| **LAN Mesh** | `CPIP_MESH=1` | 4191 | — | UDP heartbeat mesh on local network |
| **Satellite** | `CPIP_SAT=1` | 4195 | `POST /cpip/mesh/sat` | Internet-wide UDP relay with GPS coords |
| **Radio** | `CPIP_RADIO=1` | Unix socket | — | LoRa SPI, KISS TNC serial, or simulation |
| **Mobile** | `CPIP_MOBILE=1` | 4196 | `POST /cpip/mesh/mobile` | 4G/5G WWAN mesh with signal telemetry |

Satellite and mobile transports can be enabled or disabled at runtime
without restarting the server using the API or dashboard buttons.

### LAN Mesh (default)

Nodes discover each other via UDP heartbeats on port 4191. Messages use
store-and-forward delivery. E2EE with ECDH P-256 is default. Port hopping and
stealth mode are supported.

**No internet connection required.** Works over:
- Local Ethernet (wired)
- WiFi infrastructure mode
- WiFi Direct (ad-hoc/P2P)
- Any IP-based network

### Satellite Mesh (LEO / Starlink)

Internet-wide mesh relay using UDP port 4195. Designed for satellite
links with high latency. Features:
- GPS coordinate broadcasting (lat/lon/alt)
- Bootstrap seed nodes for peer discovery
- Configurable timeouts for high-latency links
- Dual env var naming (`CPIP_SAT_*` / `CPIP_STARLINK_*`) for backward compatibility

### Radio Transport (LoRa / TNC)

C-based radio interface with zero external dependencies. Built with
`gcc -O2 -Wall -pthread`. Supports:
- **SX1276/SX1278 LoRa** via SPI (full register map)
- **KISS TNC** serial (AX.25 over serial via termios)
- **RTL-SDR receive** (requires librtlsdr, build with `make RTL=1`)
- **Simulation mode** — requires explicit `--sim` flag; LoRa mode requires real hardware
- Default mode is `lora` (not `sim`)
- Duty cycle enforcement and listen-before-talk

The Python bridge (`radio/radio_protocol.py`) communicates with the C binary
over a Unix domain socket (`/tmp/cpip-radio.sock`).

### Mobile Broadband (4G/5G / LTE / WWAN)

UDP-based mesh transport over cellular data interfaces. Features:
- Automatic signal quality reading via ModemManager (`mmcli`) and sysfs
- Bootstrap seed nodes for internet-wide peer discovery
- TCP keepalive-compatible heartbeat intervals
- RSRP/RSSI/SINR telemetry

---

## Covert Channel

Messages can be hidden inside legitimate HTCPCP brew requests. The
`Accept-Additions` header carries encrypted data disguised as coffee
customization:

```
Accept-Additions: milk;variety=48656c6c, syrup;variety=6f20576f, sugar;variety=726c6421
```

To a casual observer this looks like a coffee order. In reality it has passed
"Hello World" traffic. With the Coffee Blend Cipher enabled, all payloads
appear as random hex data.

The system generates cover traffic (random brew requests at configurable
intervals) to obscure which requests carry real messages.

The dashboard Covert tab provides:
- **Encode** — Enter a message, choose a recipe, get the Accept-Additions header
- **Decode** — Paste a header, decode back to plaintext
- **History** — Previously encoded messages saved to browser localStorage with copy-to-clipboard

---

## Cryptography

All cryptographic primitives in CPIP v3 use FIPS-compliant algorithms via the
`cryptography` library, which provides constant-time implementations. The
`secrets` module replaces `random` for all security-relevant operations.
Post-quantum KEM is available via the `b4dm4n-cw` CLI (Non-FIPS).

### CoffeeCipher v3 (AES-256-GCM)

- **Cipher**: AES-256-GCM (FIPS 197) with 12-byte nonce and 16-byte authentication tag
- **Key derivation**: HKDF-SHA256 with domain-separated info strings
- **Format**: `nonce(12B) || ciphertext || GCM-tag(16B)`
- **Backward-compatible**: Reads v1 and v2 Coffee Blend Cipher messages transparently

### ECDSA/ECDH P-256

- **Key exchange**: ECDH over NIST P-256 (FIPS 186-4) via `cryptography` library
- **Signatures**: ECDSA with P-256 (FIPS 186-4) via `cryptography` library
- **Constant-time**: Uses `cryptography` library's constant-time implementations
- **Working ECDH and signatures**

### RSA-KEM-2048

- **Key encapsulation**: RSA-KEM with 2048-bit keys (FIPS 186-4 / SP 800-56B)
- **Padding**: OAEP with SHA-256 label
- **Key derivation**: HKDF-SHA256 from RSA-KEM shared secret

### HybridKEM (Classical)

- **ECDH P-256 + RSA-KEM-2048** combined key exchange
- **Key derivation**: HKDF-SHA256 from combined ECDH + RSA-KEM shared secrets
- **Hybrid guarantee**: Secure if EITHER classical component holds

### 1nf1D3L's Kyber KEM (Post-Quantum, Non-FIPS)

Available via the `b4dm4n-cw` CLI (`inf1del_kyber.py`):

- **Variant**: Non-FIPS ML-KEM-768 with 1nf1D3L modifications
- **Parameters**: n=256, k=3, q=3329, η₁=3, η₂=3, du=10, dv=4
- **Domain tag**: "1NF1D3L-KYBER-V1" on all hash/KDF inputs
- **Wider noise**: η=3 (vs FIPS η=2) — more entropy, stronger concrete security
- **NTT twiddle perturbation**: Per-session random twiddle factors for side-channel resistance
- **Coffee recipe binding**: Recipe string (espresso, cappuccino, latte, mocha, americano) mixed into KDF
- **Key confirmation**: Re-encapsulation check (implicit rejection via KDF with z)
- **Sizes**: PK=1184B, SK=2400B, CT=1120B, SS=32B
- **CLI**: `b4dm4n-cw {keygen,encaps,decaps,bench,info}`

### Hybrid PQ+Classical (Defense in Depth)

- **ECDH P-256 + 1nf1D3L Kyber** combined key exchange
- **Key derivation**: HKDF-SHA3-256 from combined ECDH + Kyber shared secrets
- **Hybrid guarantee**: Secure if EITHER component holds
- **Sizes**: PK≈1251B, SK≈2432B, CT≈1187B, SS=32B
- **CLI**: `b4dm4n-cw {hybrid-keygen,hybrid-encaps,hybrid-decaps}`

### HMAC-SHA256

- Mesh heartbeat authentication
- Message integrity verification

### SHA-256 / SHA3-256

- Domain-separated hashing for audit chain and identity
- SHA3-256 for Kyber KDF/H

### Encrypted Persistence

- v3 format with AES-256-GCM encryption and HMAC integrity verification
- v1/v2 backward-compatible load
- Data at rest encrypted with HMAC integrity

**Note**: Classical primitives (AES-256-GCM, ECDSA/ECDH P-256, RSA-KEM-2048, HKDF-SHA256, HMAC-SHA256) are FIPS-compliant.
**1nf1D3L's Kyber is NOT FIPS 203 validated** — it is a Non-FIPS ML-KEM-768 variant with wider noise (η=3), custom domain tags, NTT perturbation, and coffee recipe binding. Use for coffee protocols, red teaming, research, and survival.

---

## TLS/SSL (HTTPS)

CPIP v3 includes built-in HTTPS support with three modes:

### Auto Self-Signed Certificates

```bash
# Enable HTTPS with auto-generated self-signed cert
CPIP_SSL=1 CPIP_SSL_AUTO=1 ./server.py
```

On first startup, CPIP generates a self-signed certificate in `.ssl/cert.pem` and `.ssl/key.pem` using `openssl`. If `openssl` is unavailable, it falls back to the Python `cryptography` library, and finally to a minimal stub.

### Custom Certificates

```bash
# Use your own certificate
CPIP_SSL=1 CPIP_SSL_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem CPIP_SSL_KEY=/path/to/key.pem ./server.py
```

### HTTP→HTTPS Redirect

```bash
# Redirect HTTP (port 4181) to HTTPS (port 4180)
CPIP_SSL=1 CPIP_SSL_AUTO=1 CPIP_HTTP_REDIRECT=1 CPIP_HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT=4181 ./server.py
```

When enabled, all HTTP requests on the redirect port receive a `301 Moved Permanently` to the equivalent HTTPS URL.

### Security Headers

When SSL is active, CPIP adds:
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1`

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CPIP_SSL` | `0` | Enable HTTPS (TLS) |
| `CPIP_SSL_CERT` | — | Path to TLS certificate PEM file |
| `CPIP_SSL_KEY` | — | Path to TLS private key PEM file |
| `CPIP_SSL_AUTO` | `0` | Auto-generate self-signed cert on first run |
| `CPIP_SSL_CERT_DIR` | `.ssl` | Directory for auto-generated certs |
| `CPIP_HTTP_REDIRECT` | `0` | Enable HTTP→HTTPS redirect |
| `CPIP_HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT` | `4181` | Port for HTTP redirect server |

Every defense vector is independently togglable at runtime without restart. The
`feature` field accepts the per-vector names listed in the env-var tables above
(e.g. `stun`, `upnp`, `cell_scan`, `dpi_evasion`, `fragmentation`).

| Method | Path | Action / Payload | Description |
|--------|------|------------------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/cpip/anti-isp` | `{"action":"toggle","feature":"stun","enabled":false}` | Toggle one Anti-ISP transport |

| `PUT` | `/cpip/config` | `{"policies":{"anti_isp":{"stun":false},"net_neutrality":{"jitter":true}}}` | Bulk-update policies at runtime |

Unknown `feature` names return HTTP `400`. Toggling `enabled` or `master` on the
Anti-Stingray / Anti-Surveillance / Net-Neutrality groups starts or stops the
background scan/reaction loop.
